DeepFlow, v2.0

Our code is mentioned only for scientific or personal use.
Please contact us for commercial use.

DeepFlow2 is an improvement of DeepFlow that takes benefit of SSE instructions to speed up the computation and that incorporates a non-local weight for the smoothness term.

### Compiling ###

Simply type 'make' and the code must compile.
The program was only tested under a 64-bit Linux distribution.
A static version is also provided in case of the compilation failure.
We do not give any support for other OS or compilation issues.

### Using DeepFlow2 ###

The general command to use DeepFlow2 is:
./deepflow2 <im1> <im2> <filename.flo> [options]

For a list of the available options, you can type: ./deepflow2 -h
The option -match allows to give input matches, either from an input file or from stdin.
In particular, results from the paper use the results from DeepMatching.

### Example including DeepMatching ###

To compute DeepFlow2 including the DeepMatching, you need to download the Deep Matching code on the dedicated webpage: http://lear.inrialpes.fr/src/deepmatching/.
The matches output by DeepMatching can directly be piped to DeepFlow2 like in the following example:

<deepmatching_path>/deepmatching sintel1.png sintel2.png | ./deepflow2 sintel1.png sintel2.png sintel.flo -match -sintel
(for small size images, you can add the option "-downscale 0" when extracting deepmatching for a better accuracy)

It creates a .flo file in a standard format. 
For instance, code for reading and displaying such format is available with the Middlebury dataset.

### Warning: without matching ###

If you don't use any input match (i.e. you don't specify any -match argument), the method will be limited to a standard variational method without matching integration and thus will lose accuracy, specially for large displacements. This is the case in the opencv implementation.

### History ###

December 2013  v1.0.0
March 2014     v1.0.1: memory leak fix + support for png images
March 2014     FastDeepFlow_v1.0.1: faster (~2x) version using SSE instructions. Results are slightly different due to floating point approximations.
September 2015 v2.0: incorporation of a local smoothness weight and of the computation of matches' weights

### Matlab wrapper ###

To compile the wrapper, first compile the code using make, then open matlab and compile the mex-file:
>> mex deepflow2_matlab.cpp image.o io.o opticalflow.o opticalflow_aux.o solver.o -ljpeg -lpng -lm -output deepflow2
The wrapper has been tested on Matlab14b under Linux-64 bit. We do not provide any support for compilation issue.

Usage with DeepMatching (assuming that DeepMatching has been added to the path with the matlab wrapper compiled; note that matlab must be opened with atlas preloaded for DeepMatching computation: LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/atlas/libtatlas.so.3 matlab):
>> im1 = single(imread('sintel1.png'));
>> im2 = single(imread('sintel2.png'));
>> matches = deepmatching(im1, im2);
>> flow = deepflow2(im1, im2, matches, '-sintel');
Calling deepflow2() will show the list of available options.

### Python wrapper ###

The python wrapper requires numpy (and swig if you modify the code and recompile it). To compile it, type 'make python'. The wrapper has been tested under Linux-64 bit only. We do not provide any support for compilation issue.

Usage with DeepMatching (assuming that DeepMatching has been added to the pythonpath with the python wrapper compiled):
>> from deepmatching import deepmatching
>> from deepflow2 import deepflow2
>> import numpy
>> from PIL import Image
>> im1 = numpy.array(Image.open('sintel1.png'))
>> im2 = numpy.array(Image.open('sintel2.png'))
>> matches = deepmatching(im1, im2)
>> flow = deepflow2(im1, im2, matches, '-sintel')
Callind deepflow2() will show the list of available options.
